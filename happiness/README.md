# Data Analysis Report

## 1. Brief Description of the Data

The dataset consists of 2,363 rows and 11 columns. It appears to be related to happiness or well-being indicators across various countries and years, with the following structure and data types:

- **Year (Numeric)**: Ranges from 2005 to 2023, with a mean year of approximately 2015.
- **Life Ladder (Numeric)**: A numeric score reflecting life satisfaction, with values ranging from 1.281 to 8.019.
- **Log GDP per capita (Numeric)**: The logarithm of GDP per capita, with values ranging from 5.527 to 11.676, though it has some missing values (28 entries, 1.18%).
- **Social support (Numeric)**: Reflects the extent of social support available, ranging from 0.228 to 0.987, with 0.55% missing.
- **Healthy life expectancy at birth (Numeric)**: Values from 6.72 to 74.6, with 63 missing entries (2.67%).
- **Freedom to make life choices (Numeric)**: Ranges from 0.228 to 0.985, with 36 missing entries (1.52%).
- **Generosity (Numeric)**: Values from -0.34 to 0.7, with a significant proportion missing (81 entries, 3.43%).
- **Perceptions of corruption (Numeric)**: Ranges from 0.035 to 0.983, with 125 missing entries (5.29%).
- **Positive affect (Numeric)**: Scores between 0.179 to 0.884, with 24 missing (1.02%).
- **Negative affect (Numeric)**: Ranges from 0.083 to 0.705, with 16 entries missing (0.68%).
- **Country Name (Categorical)**: 165 unique country names, with Argentina listed as the most common (18 occurrences).

## 2. Summary of Analyses Performed

The analyses focused on summarizing the data through:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and missing values for numeric columns.
- **Categorical Analysis**: Identification of the most common country and its occurrence in the dataset.
- **Missing Data Analysis**: Assessment of the proportion and impact of missing values on various attributes.
  
## 3. Key Insights Discovered

1. **Life Satisfaction**: The average "Life Ladder" score is approximately 5.48, indicating a moderate level of life satisfaction across countries. The distribution suggests significant disparities in perceived well-being.
   
2. **Economic Indicators**: The average log GDP per capita is about 9.40, which indicates variability in economic wealth among the countries. This suggests that wealthier nations may correlate with higher life satisfaction scores.

3. **Social Support**: With an average score of 0.81 for social support, it appears that individuals generally feel supported, yet there are noteworthy differences across countries.

4. **Perceptions of Corruption**: The average score of 0.74 indicates a relatively high perception of corruption across the dataset, with a wide range of values suggesting some countries perceive lower corruption than others.

5. **Missing Data**: The variable "Perceptions of corruption" has the highest missing data percentage (5.29%), which may skew analyses involving this metric. Other variables also show substantial missing data, potentially impacting the reliability of insights derived from them.

## 4. Implications and Recommended Next Steps

### Implications:
- The moderate life satisfaction scores, combined with perceptions of corruption and economic indicators, suggest potential areas for policy reforms aimed at enhancing well-being.
- The results indicate a need for targeted programs in countries with lower social support and higher corruption perceptions to improve overall happiness levels.

### Recommended Next Steps:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Address the missing data, particularly for "Perceptions of corruption," "Generosity," and "Healthy life expectancy." Depending on the analysis goals, consider imputation methods or removing rows with excessive missing values.
   
2. **Deeper Analysis**: Conduct correlation studies to explore relationships between "Log GDP per capita," "Social support," and "Life Ladder." This may highlight economic and social factors that contribute to well-being.

3. **Segmentation by Country**: Analyze the data by different regions or income categories to identify specific trends and needs that may be relevant to localized policy decisions.

4. **Time Series Analysis**: Investigate trends over the years to identify whether there is a progression in life satisfaction and economic indicators which may provide insights into the effectiveness of past policies.

5. **Actionable Insights**: Develop targeted interventions based on findings from the analysis, particularly in countries with low life satisfaction and high perceptions of corruption or low social support.

By following these recommendations, stakeholders can align strategies with the insights drawn from the data to enhance the well-being of populations globally.
